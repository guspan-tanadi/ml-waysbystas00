# Machine Learning


## Concepts

### Inductive Bias

Fundamental assumptions that the learner makes about the target function that enables it to generalize beyond the training data. These assumptions are used to choose one generalization over another.

Examples:

* Support Vector Machines  - Distinct classes tend to be separated by wide margins.
* Naive Bayes - Each input depends only on the output class or label; the inputs are independent from each other.
* Linear Regression	- The relationship between the attributes x and the output y is linear.

## Distillation

Distillation == once a neural network has been trained, its full output distributions can be approximated using a smaller network.

## Algorithms

System order:
* First-order algorithms require a first-derivative/gradient (Jacobian).
* Second-order algorithms require a second-derivative/gradient (Hessian).

## Viewing Notes with LaTex Formulas properly rendered

Since github doesn't support JS, you will need to either download these files and view them in a markdown editor that support LaTeX or alternatively you can use some kind of browser extension that will get LaTeX formulas automatically rendered. You just install
the extension and when you browse any website with $\LaTeX$ in the html it'll automatically render it correctly.

* Chrome extensions:

   - [TeX All the Things](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tex-all-the-things/cbimabofgmfdkicghcadidpemeenbffn/related) 

If you know of good extensions for other browsers please send a PR or send me a note via the issues.
